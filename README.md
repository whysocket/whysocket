# Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Other Essential Skills

Hey there! I'm a .NET coder from Portugal. Been at it since 2019, trying to make computers do cool stuff without crashing... too much.

When I'm not coding for my day job, I'm usually busy with my side hustle, [xceltutors](https://github.com/xceltutors). It's a startup thing, fueled by questionable decisions and copious amounts of caffeine.

*Quick heads-up: That snake thing? No actual animals were messed with. My coding history, though? It's seen some rough days.*

### When the IDE is off...

Otherwise, I'm mastering the noble art of the nap or contemplating the mysteries of why my code worked yesterday but not today. I also enjoy long walks... you guessed it, to the fridge. Because you can't debug on an empty stomach.
